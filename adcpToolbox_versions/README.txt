This folder contains several versions of the adcpToolbox.R function code file from E.Chisholm's ADCP processing package.

adcpToolbox_GF3.R uses the GF3 variable naming scheme from https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/woce_v3/wocedata_1/sss/documents/liste_param.htm.
The GF3 codes are no longer governed.

adcpToolbox_P01_L0.R uses the P01 variable naming scheme from http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab_v2/search.asp?lib=P01.
The variable names have been changed to reflect the fact that the data were not corrected for magnetic declination.
